A full-stack marketplace application built as a university course project. "ilancık" provides a simple, intuitive platform for users to post items they want to sell and for buyers to browse and connect with sellers directly via their contact information.

## Overview

"ilancık" (a Turkish word for "a small ad") is a digital marketplace designed to mimic the functionality of platforms like eBay or Craigslist. A user can create an account, post an ad for an item with details like a description, price, and images, and provide their phone number. Other users can then browse these ads, view the details, and contact the seller directly to arrange a purchase.

This project was developed to demonstrate full-stack web development principles within a university curriculum.
